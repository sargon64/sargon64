## About Me

My name is Cybil (it/its). I work in analytical chemistry, specializing in the identification of illicit drugs through both gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance in ultratrace amounts. I used to work at Pyro, where I focused primarily on server orchestration and DNS using both Bind-9 and Rust. You can find me on Discord as `@sargon64`, or on Matrix as `@sargon64:matrix.org`.

Research-wise, I am working on method development for the identification of new psychoactive substances in gummy candies and on the characterization of drug metabolites in fingerprints.

Development-wise, I am working on project management and overlay development for the Beat Saber Challenge Showdown. 

You can usually find me in my lab, struggling to get things to work, or in my office, writing low-quality code in a variety of languages.
